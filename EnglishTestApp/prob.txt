<S>The team at Smartcane took on this challenge by copying the skills of animals such as bats, which emit sonar calls into their surroundings and use the echoes bouncing back from nearby objects to divert around them</S>

<S>Professor Balak at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi heads a team behind the SmartcaneTM, a new device using ultrasound to guide the visually impaired through the busy treets of India by building upon th widely used white cane. “A white cane is an excellent device, providing a lot of information to users.” he says, (A) “But it is poor at detecting obstacles that are above waist height and do not have a touch-point on the ground, such as a tree branch sticking out into your path. ” (B) The smart technology version instead sends out ultrasound waves via a device attached to a standard white cane: it detects them on thir return. and uses vibrations to inform users of any obstacles in their way. ( C ) The real benefit comes from the ultrasound scanning a 45 degree span above th knee, providing information a regular cane simply can’t provide. ( D ) As peple move the cane from left to right when they walk, vibrations detected on one side mean they should move towards the other. ( E ) Differing patterns and intensities of vibration tell users the distance of the object obstructing their path. as far as three meters away.</S>

 <S>t=To conclusively set new safety standards for CT radiation, reserchers are beginning to directly inverstigate the number of cancers among people who have received CT scans. ⓵About a dozen such studies from different countries will be publicshed in the next few years.⓶In the meantime. some reserchers have started testing whether good images can be produced with radiation doses lower than those gerated in typical CT scans. ⓷Radiologists at Mass General Hospital have an unusual way of conducting such investigations. ⓸A single CT scan subjects the human body to between 150 and 1,100 times the radiation of a conventional X-ray.⓹In that way, they scan bodies many times whithout worrying about making pepeple sick and perform an autopsy to check whether the scan has correctly identified a medical problem. Rather then recruiting living. breathing human volunteers for their studies. they work with cadavers</S>
